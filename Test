Frequently Asked Questions
What is the recommendation for me?
You can continue to work as usual. While the update runs silently in the background and does not force a restart, we recommend a standard reboot of your laptop at the end of your workday to ensure all security patches are fully initialized.
Do I need to do anything?
No. The installation is fully automated and requires no manual action. There will be no interruption to your applications or network connectivity during the process.
Who should I contact if I have issues?
Our team will be monitoring the deployment progress via the EPM Dashboard. If you experience any technical difficulties, please contact the IT Service Desk and reference the "CyberArk Agent Upgrade."
