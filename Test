Dear Colleague,
To maintain the highest standards of endpoint security and system stability, the IT Infrastructure and Security team will be performing a mandatory version upgrade to the CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) agent.
This enterprise-wide update aligns with our commitment to leveraging the latest security features and performance enhancements across our global workstation fleet.
Deployment Schedule
 * Start Date: Monday, March 2, 2026
 * End Date: Friday, March 6, 2026
Scope and Impact
This upgrade targets all Windows workstations within the EMEA and OCA regions. Please note the following regarding your user experience:
 * Silent Installation: The upgrade is classified as a "low-noise" event. It will be deployed automatically via the EPM Cloud Console and will run in the background.
 * No Service Interruption: Your current applications and workflows will remain unaffected. No manual interaction or confirmation is required during the installation process.
 * Recommended Action: While a system reboot is not forced by this update, we strongly recommend a standard restart of your device at the end of your business day during this window to ensure all security patches are fully initialized.
Support
Our monitoring systems will track the success rate of this deployment throughout the 5-day window. If you encounter any unexpected behavior or have questions regarding this security update, please contact the IT Service Desk and reference "CyberArk EPM Agent Upgrade."
We appreciate your cooperation as we continue to strengthen our corporate security posture.
